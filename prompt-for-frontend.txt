You are building a Google Cloud Hackathon project frontend for
🚰 "Intelligent Water Leak Detection",
an AI-powered sustainability dashboard.

All backend, model, and API endpoints are already completed using:

Vertex AI (trained XGBoost model for leak prediction)

FastAPI (serving /predict endpoint)

Firebase Firestore (real-time data updates from IoT sensors)

Your task is to design and generate the complete React frontend visualization system.

🧠 OBJECTIVE:

Create a modern, high-impact React dashboard that visualizes AI water leak predictions in real time.
The design must follow Google’s Material Design 3.0 principles,
use Google Cloud style visuals, and emphasize environmental sustainability.

The goal: Impress hackathon judges visually and technically.

🎨 DESIGN & VISUAL GOALS

Theme: Google Cloud Console aesthetic

Color palette: Water & AI tones

Primary: #1565C0 (blue)

Secondary: #42A5F5 (light blue)

Accent: #81C784 (eco green)

Background: #E3F2FD (light cyan)

Typography: Google Sans / Roboto

Layout:

Left sidebar for navigation

Top bar with project title and real-time update indicator

Main content → adaptive grid

📱 CORE PAGES & COMPONENTS
🏠 Dashboard Overview

KPI cards showing:

Total Active Sensors

Leaks Detected Today

Water Saved (liters)

AI Model Accuracy (from Vertex)

Time-series chart: Flow Rate & Pressure trend

Pie/Donut chart: Leak probability by sensor zone

Animated wave background (Framer Motion)

"Refresh Data" button (fetch from /predict)

🗺️ Map Visualization

Use Google Maps API (@react-google-maps/api)

Place markers for each IoT sensor (from Firebase)

Popup card when clicked:

Sensor ID

Leak Probability

Flow Rate, Pressure, Temperature

Timestamp of last reading

Marker color:

🔵 Blue → Normal

🔴 Red → Leak detected

Optional: Cluster markers in dense areas

📊 Analytics

Charts using Recharts / Chart.js

Display:

Pressure vs Flow Rate correlation

Model confidence histogram

Leak vs Non-leak trend over time

Include switch (Hourly / Daily / Monthly)

⚙️ Model Insights

Show performance metrics from Vertex AI:

Accuracy, Precision, Recall

Confusion matrix heatmap

SHAP feature importance chart

Button → “Retrain model” (links to Vertex AI pipeline)

🔧 Admin & Settings

Controls for:

Leak threshold adjustment

Sensor management (add/remove)

Notification toggles (email / SMS)

Dark & light mode switch (Material UI theme)

Real-time Firestore status indicator

⚡ TECH STACK

⚛️ React + Vite

🎨 TailwindCSS + Material UI (M3)

🗺️ Google Maps API

📈 Recharts / Chart.js

🔥 Firebase Firestore

🤖 Vertex AI REST API

⚡ Axios for requests

🎬 Framer Motion for transitions

🧩 FEATURES & INTERACTIONS

Smooth page transitions (Framer Motion)

Skeleton loaders during fetch

Toast notifications for leak alerts

Water ripple animation in background

Realtime sensor updates via Firestore

Mobile responsive grid (Material layout system)

“Powered by Google Cloud & Vertex AI” footer

🏗️ OUTPUT EXPECTATIONS

Generate:

Component hierarchy & folder structure

React Router structure for navigation

JSX + Tailwind + MUI sample components

Color & typography theme setup

Example API fetch integration with Axios

Charts & Map mockup with realistic placeholder data

Responsive layout plan (desktop/tablet/mobile)

💡 TONE & UX INSPIRATION

Google Cloud Console

Firebase Dashboard

Google Sustainability Portal

Datastudio (Looker) charts aesthetics

🎯 END GOAL

Produce a full, presentation-ready React dashboard layout and component design that:

Looks like it was built by Google’s internal Cloud UI team

Makes real-time AI predictions visually intuitive

Can be directly connected to the existing FastAPI + Vertex AI backend

Is visually stunning enough to win a global hackathon

✅ Optional Closing Instruction

“Now generate the component tree, file structure, color theme, and sample JSX code (using Tailwind + MUI + React Router).
Include animations, charts, and data binding structure with Firebase and FastAPI endpoints.”
